## Instalation

The evalmy.ai client library requires python 3.8 or higher.

``` shell
python -m pip install evalmyai
```

## Simple usage

``` python
from evalmyai import Evaluator

data = {
    "expected": "Jane is twelve.",
    "actual": "Jane is 12 yrs, 7 mths and 3 days old."
}

evaluator = Evaluator(...) # see authentication later

result = evaluator.evaluate(data)

print(result['contradictions'])
```

The result of the evaluation is as follows:

``` json
{
    "contradictions": {
        "scores": {
            "score": 1.0
        },
        "reasoning": {
            "statements": [
                {
                    "severity": "negligible",
                    "summary": "Different descriptions of Jane's age.",
                    "reasoning": "The statement from <TEXT 1> 'Jane is twelve.' is a general statement about Jane's age, indicating that she is twelve years old. The statement from <TEXT 2> 'Jane is 12 yrs, 7 mths and 3 days old.' provides a more precise age, including years, months, and days. There is no contradiction between these statements as the second text simply provides more detail about Jane's age, but does not conflict with the first text's assertion that she is twelve years old."
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## Authentication

First, you need your EVALMY.AI service token, which you can get [here](https://evalmy.ai).

The service runs on your own instance of GPT, either in Azure or directly on an OpenAI endpoint you provide.

Due to capacity limits per organization, we cannot provide an GPT endpoint directly.

### Azure

If you use an Azure endpoint, the configuration should look like this:

``` python
from evalmyai import AzureAuth, Evaluator

    token = "YOUR_EVALMYAI_TOKEN_expected_to_be_64_characters_long_CHANGE_IT!" # Replace with your evalmyai token

    # Define the Azure OpenAI authentication details
    auth_azure = AzureAuth(
        api_key="cd0...101",               # Replace with your Azure API key
        azure_endpoint="https://...azure.com/",  # Replace with your Azure endpoint URL
        api_version="2023-07-01-preview",  # Specify the API version
        azure_deployment="..."            # Specify the deployment name
    )

    # Instantiate the Evaluator with the authentication and token
    evaluator = Evaluator(
        auth=auth_azure,
        token=token
    )
```

### OpenAI

In case you use OpenAI endpoint, the configuration should look like this:

``` python
    from evalmyai import OpenAIAuth, Evaluator

    token = "YOUR_EVALMYAI_TOKEN_expected_to_be_64_characters_long_CHANGE_IT!" # Replace with your evalmyai token

    # Define the OpenAI authentication details
    auth_open_ai = OpenAIAuth(
        api_key="cd0...101",  # Replace with your OpenAI API key
        model="gpt-4o"         # Specify the model name, we strongly recommend "gpt-4o"
    )

    # Instantiate the Evaluator with the authentication and token
    evaluator = Evaluator(
        auth=auth_open_ai,
        token=token
    )
```
